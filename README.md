# NEAT-JAX

A JAX implementation of **NEAT** (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) - an evolutionary algorithm that learns both the structure and weights of neural networks.

## What is NEAT?

Instead of training neural networks with backpropagation, NEAT evolves them through natural selection:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal networks (just inputs connected to outputs)
2. **Mutate & Evolve**: Add neurons and connections, and perturb weights through random mutations
3. **Compete**: Networks compete to solve tasks - the best ones survive
4. **Speciate**: Protect innovation by grouping similar networks into species

NEAT is so interesting because it learns **topology and weights together**. NEAT discovers the right architecture while optimizing it.

**Hybrid Evolution + Backprop**: This implementation also supports optional backpropagation - when enabled, all genomes are optimized via gradient descent within each generation before fitness evaluation, combining evolutionary structure search with gradient-based weight optimization. See the `examples/classification.py` for a demonstration.

## Results: SlimeVolley

There are a couple of examples in the `examples/` folder. The most interesting one is SlimeVolley. We trained an agent to play [SlimeVolley](https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym), a game where the goal is to beat a computer-controlled opponent in a volleyball match. We started with 128 randomly-initialized fully-connected networks, which mutated, reproduced, and evolved over 500 generations.

### Evolution Progress

Open `results/evolution.gif` to see how the network evolved to play the game. It starts from a simple randomly initialized network (no hidden layers) and grows to a complex network that can play the game!

### Training Metrics

![Metrics](results/training_metrics.png)

Key observations from evolution:
- **Fitness**: Fitness is basically the same as reward in the RL world. We see that it steadily improves as networks discover better strategies (green line shows the fitness of the best network in each generation, and the blue line shows the average fitness of all networks in each generation)
- **Complexity**: Networks naturally grow more complex as they evolve, measured by the number of parameters
- **Speciation**: Multiple species emerge, protecting diverse approaches

### Gameplay

Our policy is in yellow, on the right side of the screen.

**Generation 0** (untrained):  
![Untrained](results/slimevolley_0.gif)

The randomly initialized model gets a lucky hit in the first turn, but then as expected, it loses quickly without being able to hit any other ball.

**Generation 450** (best policy):  
![Trained](results/slimevolley_450.gif)

The evolved policy learns to track the ball and make strategic plays. It plays the game for much longer before losing. If I had the resources to sweep hyperparameters, it could probably play much longer and even win!

## Quick Start

### Installation

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python environment and dependencies.

On macOS, install `uv`, create a Python 3.12 environment, and sync dependencies:

```bash
brew install uv
uv python install 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12
uv sync
```

If you prefer to activate the virtual environment manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Note: this repository requires Python 3.12 or newer.

```python
from src.population import NEATConfig
from src.evaluator import SimpleEvaluator
from src.trainer import evolve
import jax

config = NEATConfig() # contains hyperparams; use defaults
evaluator = SimpleEvaluator(your_fitness_function)

# Note: `your_fitness_function` above is a function
# that takes a genome and a JAX random key and returns
# a fitness score

# Evolve! (Train!)
result = evolve(
  n_inputs=3, # number of inputs
  n_outputs=5, # number of outputs
  generations=500, # number of generations
  evaluator=evaluator,
  config=config,
  key=jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
)
```

### Running the examples

Run examples from the repository root using module mode:

```bash
uv run python -m examples.classification
uv run python -m examples.classification --save-best-genome
uv run python -m examples.classification --plot-decision-boundary
uv run python -m examples.classification --save-best-genome --plot-decision-boundary --output-dir results/my_run
uv run python -m examples.slimevolley
uv run python -m examples.cartpole
uv run python -m examples.xor
```

The classification example supports these optional flags:
- `--save-best-genome`: saves the best evolved genome as JSON.
- `--plot-decision-boundary`: renders and saves a 2D decision-boundary image for the best genome.
- `--output-dir`: chooses where those output files are written. The default is `results/classification`.

Using `python examples/<name>.py` may fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` because these examples import from the repository root. Running them with `python -m examples.<name>` keeps the root directory on the Python import path.

See `examples/` for complete examples (XOR, CartPole, SlimeVolley, classification task with backprop).
